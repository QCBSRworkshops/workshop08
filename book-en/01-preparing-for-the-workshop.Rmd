# (PART\*) Generalized Additive Models in `R` {-}

# Summary and Learning objectives
## Summary
The goal of today's workshop will be to first examine what
we mean by a non-linear model, and how Generalized Additive
Models (GAMs) allow us to handle non-linear relationships. We will also go
over how to plot and interpret these non-linear relationships, how to
include interaction terms, autocorrelated errors and expand on previous
workshop by briefly examining a mixed modelling framework. Lastly, we
will briefly touch upon what GAMs are doing behind the scenes.

## Learning Objectives

1.  Use the `mgcv` package to fit non-linear relationships,
2.  Understand the output of a GAM to help you understand your data,
3.  Use tests to determine if a non-linear model fits better than a
    linear one,
4.  Include smooth interactions between variables,
5.  Understand the idea of a basis function, and why it makes GAMs so
    powerful,
6.  Account for dependence in data (autocorrelation, hierarchical
    structure) using GAMMs.


# Preparing for the workshop

To prepare for this workshop, you must do the following steps:

Download the R script and data required for this workshop:

-    [R Script](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/gam_e.r)
-    [Data](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/other_dist.csv)

Make sure to load the following packages (see how in the R script):

-    [ggplot2 (for plotting)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)
-    [mgcv (for GAM fitting)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html)
-    [itsadug (for visualization of GAMs)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/itsadug/index.html)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("mgcv")
install.packages("itsadug")

library(ggplot2)
library(itsadug)
library(itsadug)

source(file.choose()) # use coldiss.R which you have downloaded to your own directory
```
