# 1. The linear model

## ...and where if fails

---
# Linear regression

Regression is the workhorse of statistics. It allows us to model a response variable as a function of predictors plus error.

--

As we saw in the [linear models workshop](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/r_workshop4), a linear model is based on 4 major assumptions:

1. Linear relationship between response and predictor variables: `$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x_i + \epsilon_i$$`
2. Normally distributed error: `$$\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma^2)$$`
3. Homogeneity of the variance
4. Independance of the errors

&lt;br&gt;

--

*Linear model with multiple predictors:*

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1,i}+\beta_2x_{2,i}+\beta_3x_{3,i}+...+\beta_kx_{k,i} + \epsilon_i$$`

???
- A linear model can easily accomodate certain types of non-linear responses (e.g. `\(x^2\)`) but this approach strongly relies on (arbitrary or well-informed) choices, and is less flexible than using and additive model.

# Linear regression

There's only one way for the linear model to be right:

# Linear regression

**What's the problem and do we fix it?**

A **linear model** tries to fit the best **straight line** that passes through the data, so it doesn't work well for all datasets.

In contrast, a **GAM** can capture complexe relationships by fitting a **non-linear smooth function** through the data, while controlling how wiggly the smooth can get (more on this later).

## 2. Introduction to GAM

# Generalized Additive Models (GAM)

Let's look at an example. First, we will load the `ISIT` datasets.


```r
isit &lt;- read.csv("data/ISIT.csv")
head(isit)
```

This datasets is comprised of bioluminescence levels (`Sources`) in relation to depth, seasons and different stations.


For now, let's focus on Season 2.



```r
isit2 &lt;- subset(isit, Season==2)
```

---
# GAM

Trying to fit `Sources` to `SampleDepth` as a linear regression model, we would violate the assumptions listed above.

```r
linear_model &lt;- gam(Sources ~ SampleDepth, data = isit2)
data_plot &lt;- ggplot(isit2, aes(y = Sources, x = SampleDepth)) + geom_point() +
             geom_line(colour = "red", size = 1.2,aes(y = fitted(linear_model))) + theme_bw()
data_plot
```

# Generalized Additive Models (GAM)

Let's look at an example. First, we'll generate some data, and plot it.


```r
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(10)
n &lt;- 250
x &lt;- runif(n,0,5)
y_model &lt;- 3*x/(1+2*x)
y_obs &lt;- rnorm(n,y_model,0.1)
data_plot &lt;- qplot(x, y_obs) +
  geom_line(aes(y=y_model)) +
  theme_bw()
data_plot
```

Trying to fit these data as a linear regression model, we would violate the assumptions listed above.

# GAM

**Relationship between the response variable and predictor variables**

One predictor variable:
`$$y_i = \beta_0 + f(x_i) + \epsilon$$`

Multiple predictor variables:
`$$y_i = \beta_0 + f_1(x_{1,i}) + f_2(x_{2,i}) + ... + \epsilon$$`

One big advantage of using a GAM over a manual specification of the model is that the optimal shape, i.e. *the degree of smoothness* of `\(f(x)\)`, is determined automatically depending on the fitting method (usually maximum likelihood).

???

- Strictly speaking, the equations are for a Gaussian GAM with identity link, which is also called "additive model" (without "generalized").

#GAM

Let's try to fit a model to the data using a smooth function `s()` with `mgcv::gam()`


```r
gam_model &lt;- gam(Sources ~ s(SampleDepth), data = isit2)

```

Let's try to fit the data using a smooth function `s()` with `mgcv::gam()`

data_plot &lt;- data_plot +

# Test for linearity using GAM

We can use `gam()` and `AIC()` to test whether an assumption of linearity is justified. To do so, we must simply set our smoothed model so that it is nested in our linear model.


```r
linear_model &lt;- gam(Sources ~ SampleDepth, data = isit2) # fit a regular linear model using gam()
nested_gam_model &lt;- gam(Sources ~ s(SampleDepth), data = isit2)
AIC(linear_model, nested_gam_model)
#                        df      AIC
# linear_model      3.00000 3143.720
# nested_gam_model 10.90825 2801.451
```

**AIC of the nested gam is lower, so linearity is not justified**

.comment[Note that the model `y ~ s(x)` is nested in the model `y ~ x`.]

---
exclude:true
# Test for linearity using GAM

We can use `gam()` and `anova()` to test whether an assumption of linearity is justified. To do so, we must simply set our smoothed model so that it is nested in our linear model.


```r
linear_model &lt;- gam(y_obs ~ x) # fit a regular linear model using gam()
nested_gam_model &lt;- gam(y_obs ~ s(x) + x)
anova(linear_model, nested_gam_model, test = "Chisq")
```

.comment[Note that the model `y_obs~s(x)` gives exactly the same results as `y_obs~s(x)+x`. We used the s(x)+x to illustrate the nestedness of the model, but the +x can be omitted.]

# Challenge 1 ![:cube]()

We will now try this comparison test with the data recorded in the first season, just to get a handle on it.


```r
isit1 &lt;- subset(isit, Season==1)
```

1. Fit a linear and smoothed GAM model to the relation between `SampleDepth` and `Sources`.
2. Determine if linearity is justified for this data.
3. How many effective degrees of freedom does the smoothed term have?

**Answer** Yes, non-linearity is justified. The effective degrees of freedom (**EDF**) are &gt;&gt; 1 (we'll get back to this soon).

```

1. Fit a linear and smoothed GAM model to the relation between `x_test` and `y_test_obs`.
2. Determine if linearity is justified for this data.
3. What is the estimated degrees of freedom of the smoothed term?

# A closer look at GAMs

We will now take a few minutes to look at what GAMs are doing behind the scenes. Lets first consider a simple model containing one smooth function `\(f\)` of one covariate, `\(x\)`:

`$$y_i = f(x_i) + \epsilon_i$$`

To estimate the smooth function `\(f\)`, we need to represented the above equation in such a way that it becomes a linear model. This can be done by defining basis functions, `\(b_j(x)\)`, of which `\(f\)` is composed:

`$$f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^q b_j(x) \times \beta_j$$`
---
# Example: a polynomial basis

Suppose that `\(f\)` is believed to be a 4th order polynomial, so that the space of polynomials of order 4 and below contains `\(f\)`. A basis for this space would then be:

`$$b_0(x)=1 \ , \quad b_1(x)=x \ , \quad b_2(x)=x^2 \ , \quad b_3(x)=x^3 \ , \quad b_4(x)=x^4$$`

so that `\(f(x)\)` becomes:

`$$f(x) = \beta_0 + x\beta_1 +  x^2\beta_2 + x^3\beta_3 + x^4\beta_4$$`

and the full model now becomes:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + x_i\beta_1 +  x^2_i\beta_2 + x^3_i\beta_3 + x^4_i\beta_4 + \epsilon_i$$`
---
# Example: a polynomial basis


The basis functions are each multiplied by a real valued parameter, `\(\beta_j\)`, and are then summed to give the &lt;font color="orange"&gt;final curve `\(f(x)\)`&lt;/font&gt;.

.center[
![:scale 85%](images/polynomial_basis_example.png)
]


By varying the `\(\beta_j\)` we can vary the form of `\(f(x)\)` to produce any polynomial function of order 4 or lower.

---
# Example: a cubic spline basis

A cubic spline is a curve constructed from sections of a cubic polynomial joined together so that they are continuous in value. Each section of cubic has different coefficients.

.center[
![](images/cubic_spline.png)
]

---
# Example: a cubic spline basis

Here's a representation of a smooth function using a rank 5 cubic spline basis with knot locations at increments of 0.2:

.center[
![:scale 40%](images/cubic_spline5.jpg)
]

Here, the knots are evenly spaced through the range of observed x values. However, the choice of the degree of model smoothness is controlled by the the number of knots, which was arbitrary.

.comment[Is there a better way to select the knot locations?]

---
# Controlling the degree of smoothing with penalized regression splines

Instead of controlling smoothness by altering the number of knots, we keep that fixed to size a little larger than reasonably necessary, and control the model’s smoothness by adding a “wiggleness” penalty.

So, rather than fitting the model by minimizing (as with least squares regression):

`$$||y - XB||^{2}$$`

it can be fit by minimizing:

`$$||y - XB||^{2} + \lambda \int_0^1[f^{''}(x)]^2dx$$`

As `\(\lambda\)` goes to infinity, the model becomes linear.

---
# Controlling the degree of smoothing with penalized regression splines

If `\(\lambda\)` is too high then the data will be over smoothed, and if it is too low then the data will be under smoothed.

Ideally, it would be good to choose `\(\lambda\)` so that the predicted `\(\hat{f}\)` is as close as possible to `\(f\)`. A suitable criterion might be to choose `\(\lambda\)` to minimize:

`$$M = 1/n \times \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{f_i} - f_i)^2$$`

Since `\(f\)` is unknown, `\(M\)` must be estimated. The recommend methods for this are maximum likelihood (*ML*) or restricted maximum likelihood estimation (*REML*). Generalized cross validation (*GCV*) is another possibility.

1. fits many of the data poorly and does no better with the missing point.



2. fits the underlying signal quite well, smoothing through the noise and the missing datum is reasonably well predicted.



3. fits the noise as well as the signal and the extra variability induced causes it to predict the missing datum rather poorly.

## 3. GAM with multiple smooth terms

# GAM with multiple variables

GAMs make it easy to include both smooth and linear terms, multiple smoothed terms, and smoothed interactions.

For this section, we will use the `ISIT` data again.


```r
head(isit)
isit$Season &lt;- as.factor(isit$Season)
```

We will try to model the response `Sources` using the predictors `Season` and `SampleDepth` simultaneously.

.comment[`Season` needs to be converted into a factor] 

---
# GAM with multiple variables

Let's start with a basic model, with one smoothed term (`SampleDepth`) and one categorical predictor (`Season`, which has 2 levels).



```r
isit$Season &lt;- as.factor(isit$Season)
basic_model &lt;- gam(Sources ~ Season + s(SampleDepth), data = isit, method = "REML")
basic_summary &lt;- summary(basic_model)
```

The `p.table` provides information on the linear terms:


```r
basic_summary$p.table
#             Estimate Std. Error  t value     Pr(&gt;|t|)
# (Intercept) 7.253273  0.3612666 20.07734 1.430234e-72
# Season2     6.156130  0.4825491 12.75752 5.525673e-34
```

The `s.table` provides information on the smooth term:


```r
basic_summary$s.table
#                     edf   Ref.df        F p-value
# s(SampleDepth) 8.706426 8.975172 184.3583       0
```

exclude:true
# GAM with multiple variables

GAMs make it easy to include both smooth and linear terms, multiple smoothed terms, and smoothed interactions.

For this section, we will use simulated data generated using `mgcv::gamSim()`.


```r
# ?gamSim
gam_data &lt;-  gamSim(eg = 5)
head(gam_data)
```

We will try to model the response `y` using the predictors `x0` to `x3`.

---
exclude:true
# GAM with multiple variables

Let's start with a basic model, with one smoothed term (x1) and one categorical predictor (x0, which has 4 levels).


```r
basic_model &lt;- gam(y ~ x0 + s(x1), data = gam_data)
basic_summary &lt;- summary(basic_model)
basic_summary$p.table

basic_summary$s.table
```

There is a pronounced difference in bioluminescence between the seasons.

---
# Effective degrees of freedom (EDF)


```r
basic_summary$s.table
#                     edf   Ref.df        F p-value
# s(SampleDepth) 8.706426 8.975172 184.3583       0
```

The `edf` shown in the `s.table` are the **effective degrees of freedom** (EDF) of the the smooth term - essentially, more EDF imply more complex, wiggly splines.

- A value close to 1 tends to be close to a linear term.

- A higher value  means that the spline is non-linear.

&gt; In our basic model the EDF of the smooth function `s(SampleDepth)` are ~9, which suggests a highly non-linear curve.

---
# Effective degrees of freedom (EDF)

The **EDF** of a GAM are estimated differently from the degrees of freedom in a linear regression.

In linear regression, the *model* degrees of freedom are equivalent to the number of non-redundant free parameters `\(p\)` in the model (and the *residual* degrees of freedom are given by `\(n-p\)`).

Because the number of free parameters in GAMs is difficult to define, the **EDF** are related to the smoothing parameter `\(\lambda\)`, such that the greater the penalty, the smaller the **EDF**.

---
# Basis dimension and EDF

An upper bound on the **EDF** is determined by the basis dimension `\(k\)` for each smooth function (the **EDF** cannot exceed `\(k-1\)`)

In practice, the exact choice of `\(k\)` is arbitrary, but it should be **large enough** to accomodate a sufficiently complex smooth function.

We will talk about choosing `\(k\)` in section 5.

---
# GAM with multiple variables

We can add a second term, `RelativeDepth`, but specify a linear relationship with `Sources`


```r
two_term_model &lt;- gam(Sources ~ Season + s(SampleDepth) + RelativeDepth, 
                      data = isit, method = "REML")
two_term_summary &lt;- summary(two_term_model)
```

## 4. Interactions

---
# GAM with interaction terms

There are 2 ways to include interactions between variables:

- for 2 smoothed variables : `s(x1, x2)`
- for one smoothed variable and one linear variable (either factor or continuous): use the `by` argument `s(x1, by = x2)`
  - When `x2` is a factor, you have a smooth term that vary between different levels of `x2`
  - When `x2` is continuous, the linear effect of `x2` varies smoothly with `x1`
  - When `x2` is a factor, the factor needs to be added as a main effect in the model

---
# GAM with interaction terms

We will examine interaction effect using our categorical variable `Season` and ask whether the non-linear smoother `s(SampleDepth)` varies across different levels of `Season`.


```r
factor_interact &lt;- gam(Sources ~ Season + 
                         s(SampleDepth, by=Season) + 
                         s(RelativeDepth), 
                       data = isit, method = "REML")

```

# GAM with interaction terms

summary(factor_interact)$s.table
```

# GAM with interaction terms

We can also visualise our model in 3D using `vis.gam`, where `theta` is the degree rotation on the x-y plane


```r
vis.gam(factor_interact, view = c("x2","x0"), theta = 40, n.grid = 500, border = NA)
```

---
# GAM with interaction terms

Let's perform a model comparison using AIC to determine if the interaction term is necessary


```r
AIC(two_smooth_model, factor_interact)
#                        df      AIC
# two_smooth_model 20.46960 5056.841
# factor_interact  26.99693 4878.631
```

From the plots, we saw that the shape of the smooth terms were comparable among the 2 levels of `Season`. The AIC confirms this as well.

---
# GAM with interaction terms

Finally we'll look at the interactions between 2 smoothed terms, `SampleDepth` and `RelativeDepth`.


```r
smooth_interact &lt;- gam(Sources ~ Season + s(SampleDepth, RelativeDepth), 
                       data = isit, method = "REML")

summary(smooth_interact)$s.table
```

```r
vis.gam(smooth_interact, view = c("SampleDepth", "RelativeDepth"), 
        cond = list(Season = 1), theta=40, n.grid = 50, color = "cm")
```

# two_smooth_model 20.46960 5056.841
# smooth_interact  30.33625 4943.890
```

The model with the interaction between `s(SampleDepth)` and `s(RelativeDepth)` has a lower AIC and the plots nicely illustrate the non-linear interaction, where `Sources` is lower at high values of `SampleDepth` but increases with `RelativeDepth`.

## 5. Generalization of the additive model

---

# Generalization of the additive model

The basic additive model can be extended in the following way:

1. Using other **distributions** for the response variable with the `family` argument (just as in a GLM),
2. Using different kinds of **basis functions**,
3. Using different kinds of **random effects** to fit mixed effect models.

We will now go over these aspects.

---

# Generalized additive models

We have so far worked with simple (Gaussian) additive models, the non-linear equivalent to a linear model.

--

But what can we do if:
- the observations of the response variable do **not follow a normal distribution**?
- the **variance is not constant**? (heteroscedasticity)

--

.comment[These cases are very common!]

Just like generalized linear models (GLM), we can formulate **generalized** additive models to deal with these issues.

---

# Generalized additive models


Lets recall the interaction model for the bioluminescence data:


```r
smooth_interact &lt;- gam(Sources ~ Season + s(SampleDepth, RelativeDepth), 
                       data = isit, method = "REML")

summary(smooth_interact)$p.table
#             Estimate Std. Error   t value     Pr(&gt;|t|)
# (Intercept) 8.077356  0.4235432 19.070912 1.475953e-66
# Season2     4.720806  0.6559436  7.196969 1.480113e-12

summary(smooth_interact)$s.table
#                                   edf Ref.df        F p-value
# s(SampleDepth,RelativeDepth) 27.12521  28.77 93.91722       0
```

# GAM model checking

As for a GLM, it is essential to check whether we correctly specifified the model, especially the *distribution* for the response.

**We have to verify:**

1. The choice of basis dimension `k`.
2. The residuals plots (just as for a GLM).


--

&lt;br&gt;
Useful functions included in `mgcv`:

- `k.check()` performs a basis dimension check.
- `gam.check()` produces residual plots (and also calls `k.check()`).

---

# GAM model checking

##### First step:

Have we chosen `k` large enough? 

.comment[The default for smooth interactions is `k = 30`]


```r
k.check(smooth_interact)
#                              k'      edf   k-index p-value
# s(SampleDepth,RelativeDepth) 29 27.12521 0.9448883    0.07
```

--

The **EDF are very close to** `k`, this could be problematic.

---

# GAM model checking

Let's refit the model with a larger `k`:


```r
smooth_interact_k60 &lt;- gam(Sources ~ Season + s(SampleDepth, RelativeDepth, k = 60), 
                           data = isit, method = "REML")
summary(smooth_interact_k60)$p.table
#             Estimate Std. Error   t value     Pr(&gt;|t|)
# (Intercept) 8.129512  0.4177659 19.459491 1.911267e-68
# Season2     4.629964  0.6512205  7.109672 2.741865e-12
summary(smooth_interact_k60)$s.table
#                                   edf   Ref.df        F p-value
# s(SampleDepth,RelativeDepth) 46.03868 54.21371 55.19817       0
```

--

Is `k` large enough this time?


```r
k.check(smooth_interact_k60)
#                              k'      edf  k-index p-value
# s(SampleDepth,RelativeDepth) 59 46.03868 1.048626     0.9
```

--

Looks better, let's replace the old model:


```r
smooth_interact &lt;- smooth_interact_k60
```

---

# GAM model checking

##### Second Step:

Let's look at the residual plots, using `gam.check()`:


```r
par(mfrow = c(2,2)) # Show all 4 plots side by side
gam.check(smooth_interact)
```

.comment[In addition to the plots, `gam.check()` also provides the output of `k.check()`.]

---

# GAM model checking

--
&lt;br&gt;

.alert[Pronounced heteroscedasticity and patterns in the residuals]


???

- These plots are a little different than those produced by `plot` for a linear model (e.g. no leverage plot)
- Participants should already be familiar with residual plots (they are explaned more in detail in workshops 4 and 6)
- Obvious problem: heteroscedasticity, visible in residuals vs. linear predictor.
- Another problem: a few strong outliers (visible in QQ plot, response vs. fitted)

---

# Other distributions


For our interaction model, we need a probability distribution that allows the **variance to increase with the mean**.

--

One family of distributions that has this property and that works well in a GAM is the **Tweedie** family.

A common link function for *Tweedie* distributions is the `\(log\)`.

--

&lt;br&gt;

As in a GLM, we can use the `family = ` argument in `gam()` to fit models with other distributions (including distributions such as `binomial`, `poisson`, `gamma` etc.).

To get an overview of families available in `mgcv`:

```r
?family.mgcv
```




---

# Challenge 3 ![:cube]()

1. Fit a new model `smooth_interact_tw` with the same formula as the `smooth_interact` model but with a distribution from the *Tweedie* family (instead of the normal distribution) and `log` link function. You can do so by using `family = tw(link = "log")` inside `gam()`.
2. Check the choice of `k` and the residual plots for the new model.
3. Compare `smooth_interact_tw` with `smooth_interact`. Which one would you choose?

--

&lt;br&gt;

- The residuals look much better, but it is clear that something is missing from the model. This could be a spatial affect (longtitude and latitude), or a random effect (e.g. based on `Station`).

# Other smooth functions

To model a non-linear smooth variable or surface, smooth functions can be built in different ways:

`s()` ![:faic](arrow-right) for modeling a 1-dimensional smooth or for modeling interactions among variables measured using the same unit and the same scale

`te()` ![:faic](arrow-right)  for modeling 2- or n-dimensional interaction surfaces of variables that are not on the same scale. Includes main effects.

`ti()` ![:faic](arrow-right) for modeling 2- or n-dimensional interaction surfaces that do not include the main effects.

---
# Parameters of smooth functions

The smooth functions have several parameters that can be set to change their behavior. The most often-used parameters are :

`k` ![:faic](arrow-right) basis dimension
  - determines the upper bound of the number of base functions used to build the curve.
  - constrains the wigglyness of a smooth.
  - the default `\(k\)` is 10 for `s()`, and 5 for `te()` and `ti()`.
  - k should be &lt; the number of unique data points.
  - the comlexity (i.e. non-linearity) of a smooth function in a fitted model is reflected by its effective degrees of freedom (**EDF**).


---
# Parameters of smooth functions

The smooth functions have several parameters that can be set to change their behavior. The most often-used parameters are :

`d` ![:faic](arrow-right) specifies that predictors in the interaction are on the same scale or dimension (only used in `te()` and `ti()`).
  - For example, in `te(Time, width, height, d=c(1,2))`, indicates that `width` and `height` are one the same scale, but not `Time`.

`bs` ![:faic](arrow-right) specifies the type of underlying base functions.
  - the default for `s()` is `tp` (thin plate regression spline) and for `te()` and `ti()` is `cr` (cubic regression spline).

&lt;!--last 2 slides were a copy-paste from this websites: http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~jvanrij/Tutorial/GAMM.html. However, as I'm not a specialist of GAM, I let them asis, but we should modify them or at least site the website--&gt;

# Example smooth for cyclical data

Cyclical data is a good example where changing basis is useful: you want the predictor to match at the ends.

Let's use a time series of climate data, with monthly measurements, and see if there's a temporal trend in yearly temperature.


```r
data(nottem) # Nottingham temperature time series
n_years &lt;- length(nottem)/12
nottem_month &lt;- rep(1:12, times = n_years)
nottem_year &lt;- rep(1920:(1920 + n_years - 1), each = 12)
qplot(nottem_month, nottem, colour = factor(nottem_year), geom = "line") +
  theme_bw()
```

# Example smooth for cyclical data

We can model both the cyclic change of temperature across months and the non-linear trend through years, using a cyclical cubic spline, or `cc`, for the month variable and a regular smooth for the year variable.


```r
year_gam &lt;- gam(nottem ~ s(nottem_year) + s(nottem_month, bs = "cc"), method = "REML")
summary(year_gam)$s.table
#                      edf   Ref.df          F    p-value
# s(nottem_year)  1.621375 2.011475   2.850888 0.06141004
# s(nottem_month) 6.855132 8.000000 393.119285 0.00000000
```

# Example smooth for cyclical data


```r
plot(year_gam, page = 1, scale = 0)
```

&lt;img src="workshop08-pres-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-88-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

There is about 1-1.5 degree rise in temperature over the period, but within a given year there is about 20 degrees variation in temperature, on average. The actual data vary around these values and that is the unexplained variance.

# Dealing with non-independence

When observations are not independent, GAMs can be used to either incorporate:

- a serial correlation structure to model residual autocorrelation (autoregressive AR, moving average MA, or a combination of the two ARMA),
- random effects that model independence among observations from the same site.

---
# Model with correlated errors

Let's have a look at a model with temporal autocorrelation in the residuals. We will revisit the Nottingham temperature model and test for correlated errors using the (partial) autocorrelation function.


```r
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
acf(resid(year_gam), lag.max = 36, main = "ACF")
pacf(resid(year_gam), lag.max = 36, main = "pACF")
```

---
# Model with correlated errors

&lt;img src="workshop08-pres-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-90-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.comment[ACF evaluates the cross correlation and pACF the partial correlation of a time series with itself at different time lags]

ACF and pACF are used to identify after how many time steps observations start to be independent.

--

The ACF plot of our model residuals suggests a significant lag of 1, and perhaps a lag of 2. Therefore, a low-order AR model is likely needed.

---
# Model with correlated errors

We can add AR structures to the model: 

- **AR(1)**: correlation at 1 time step, or 
- **AR(2)** correlation at 2 time steps.

--


```r
year_gam &lt;- gamm(nottem ~ s(nottem_year) + s(nottem_month, bs = "cc"))
year_gam_AR1 &lt;- gamm(nottem ~ s(nottem_year) + s(nottem_month, bs = "cc"),
                     correlation = corARMA(form = ~ 1|nottem_year, p = 1),
                   data = data.frame(nottem, nottem_year, nottem_month))
year_gam_AR2 &lt;- gamm(nottem ~ s(nottem_year) + s(nottem_month, bs = "cc"),
                     correlation = corARMA(form = ~ 1|nottem_year, p = 2),
                   data = data.frame(nottem, nottem_year, nottem_month))
```


---

# Model with correlated errors


```r
AIC(year_gam$lme, year_gam_AR1$lme, year_gam_AR2$lme)
#                  df      AIC
# year_gam$lme      5 1109.908
# year_gam_AR1$lme  6 1101.218
# year_gam_AR2$lme  7 1101.598
```

AR(1) provides a better fit over the naive model. But there is little improvement with AR(2).

# Mixed modelling

As we saw in the section changing basis, `bs` specifies the type of underlying base function. For random intercepts and linear random slopes we use `bs = "re"`, but for random smooths we use `bs = "fs"`.

--

**3 different types of random effects** in GAMMs (`fac` ![:faic](arrow-right) factor coding for the random effect; `x0` ![:faic](arrow-right) continuous fixed effect):

- **random intercepts** adjust the height of other model terms with a constant value: `s(fac, bs = "re")`
- **random slopes** adjust the slope of the trend of a numeric predictor: `s(fac, x0, bs = "re")`
- **random smooths** adjust the trend of a numeric predictor in a nonlinear way: `s(x0, fac, bs = "fs", m = 1)`, where the argument m=1 sets a heavier penalty for the smooth moving away from 0, causing shrinkage to the mean.

---
# GAMM with a random intercept

As before, we will use the `gamSim()` function to generate a dataset, here with a random effect, then run a model with a random intercept using `fac` as the random factor.

# Ressources

There's a great deal more out there on GAM… this was just the very surface.

Simon Wood, the author of the `mgcv` package has a very useful [website](http://people.bath.ac.uk/sw283/mgcv/) with introductory talks and notes on how to use GAM.

He's also written a book, Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R, which we used as reference for this workshop.

Material from this workshop were also obtained from the following fantastic blogs and tutorials:

- [From the bottom of the heap](http://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/blog/)

- [Overview GAMM analysis of time series data](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~jvanrij/Tutorial/GAMM.html)

- [Advanced Analysis of Time series data](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~jvanrij/LSA2015/AnswersLab2.html)

Finally, the help pages, available through `?gam` in R, are an excellent resource.

# GAM using other distributions

Let's now take a look on how to use GAMs when the response variable does not follow a normal distributions and is either count or proportion data (e.g., Gamma, binomial, Poisson, negative binomial).

We will use an example dataset where a binomial distribution is needed; the response variable represents the number of successes vs failures over the course of an experiment.


```r
gam_data3 &lt;- read.csv("data/other_dist.csv")
str(gam_data3)
# 'data.frame':	514 obs. of  4 variables:
#  $ prop : num  1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 ...
#  $ total: int  4 20 20 18 18 18 20 20 20 20 ...
#  $ x1   : int  550 650 750 850 950 650 750 850 950 550 ...
#  $ fac  : chr  "f1" "f1" "f1" "f1" ...
```

&lt;!-- should change the name of the variables in the csv files, to make them meaningful--&gt;

# GAM using other distributions

abline(h = 0.5)

avg &lt;- aggregate(prop ~ x1, data = gam_data3, mean)

# GAM using other distributions

We will test if this trend is linear or not using a logistic GAM (we use a binomial family distribution given that our response is proportion data).

                  family = "binomial", method = "REML")

# (Intercept) 1.174024 0.02709868 43.32402        0
```

Recall that the model uses the count data to calculate the logit, which is the log odds ratio between successes and failures:
.small[
- If successes = failures, the ratio = 1 and the logit is 0 (log(1) = 0).
- If successes &gt; failures, the ratio &gt; 1 and the logit has a positive value (log(2) = 0.69).
- If successes &lt; failures, the ratio &lt; 1 and the logit has a negative value (log(.5) = -0.69).
]

--

&gt; Here, the estimated intercept coefficient is positive, which means that there are more successes than failures overall.

This represents how the log odds of successes vs failures change over time (x1).

--

&gt; As the **EDF** &gt; 1, the proportion of successes increases faster over time

# Visualizing the trend over time

There are different ways this relationship can be represented graphically:

- **partial effects** are the isolated effects of one particular predictor or interaction. If you visualize your GAM model with `plot()`, you get the partial effects.
- **summed effects** are the predicted response measures for a given value or level of predictors. If you visualize your GAM model with `itsadug::plot_smooth()`, you get the summed effects.


---
# Visualizing the trend over time

What do these plots tell us about successes vs failures?

&lt;img src="workshop08-pres-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-118-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



.pull-left[
**Contribution / partial effect**

Over time the log odds increases, so over time successes increase and failures decrease.]

.pull-right[
**Fitted values, summed effect, intercept included**

Equal amounts of successes and failures up to x1=400.
]

&lt;!-- this code should be shown but it is not well explained...--&gt;
---
# Visualizing the trend over time

Lastly, to help interpret the results, we could transform the summed effects back to proportions with the function `itsadug::plot_smooth()`:


```r
plot_smooth(prop_model, view = "x1", main = "",
            transform = plogis, ylim = c(0,1), print.summary = F)
abline(h = 0.5, v = diff$start, col = 'red', lty = 2)
```

&lt;img src="workshop08-pres-en_files/figure-html/fig.width==4-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

As in the logit plot, the proportion of successes increases above 0.5 at x1=400.
