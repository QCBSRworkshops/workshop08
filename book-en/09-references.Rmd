There's a great deal more out there on GAMs. This was just the very
surface.

Simon Wood, the author of the `mgcv` package, has a very useful website
with introductory talks and notes on how to use GAMs:

He's also written a book, Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction
with R, which we used as reference for this workshop.

Material from this workshop were also obtained from the following
fantastic blogs and tutorials:

-   <http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~jvanrij/LSA2015/AnswersLab2.html>

Finally, the help pages, available through `?gam` in R, are an excellent
resource.
