# Other distributions

To provide a brief overview on how to use GAMs when the response
variable does not follow a normal distributions and is either count or
proportion data (e.g., Gamma, binomial, Poisson, negative binomial), the
example that follows uses a dataset where a binomial family distribution
is needed and a non-linear relationship with the explanatory variable is
evident. Here, the response variable represents the number of successes
(event happened) versus failures over the course of an experiment.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
gam_data3 <- read.csv("other_dist.csv")
summary(gam_data3)
str(gam_data3)
```

    'data.frame': 514 obs. of  4 variables:
     $ prop : num  1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 ...
     $ total: int  4 20 20 18 18 18 20 20 20 20 ...
     $ x1   : int  550 650 750 850 950 650 750 850 950 550 ...
     $ fac  : Factor w/ 4 levels "f1","f2","f3",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...

`prop` is the response variable, and is equal to the proportion of
*successes / (successes + failures)*. Note that there are numerous cases
where the proportion equals 1 or 0 which indicates that the outcomes
were always successes or failures, respectively, at a given time point
in the experiment.

`x1` is the time since the start of experiment (our explanatory
variable).

`total` represents the number of *successes + failures* observed at any
time point of the experiment.

`fac` is a factor coding for trials 1 through 4 of the experiment (we
will not use this variable in this section).

Let's start by visualizing the data. We are interested in the number of
successes in comparison to failures as `x1` increases. We will calculate
the grand averages of the proportions of successes per time bin (`x1`)
given that there are repeated measures per `x1` value (numerous trials and
observations per trial).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
emptyPlot(range(gam_data3$x1), c(0,1), h=.5,
          main="Probability of successes", ylab="Probability",xlab="x1")

avg <- aggregate(prop ~ x1, data=gam_data3, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
lines(avg$x1, avg$prop, col="orange",lwd=2)
```

As `x1` increases, so does the probability of successes. Would you say
that this trend is linear or non-linear? We will test this using a
logistic GAM (we use a `binomial` family distribution given that our
response is proportion data).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
prop_model <- gam(prop~ s(x1), data=gam_data3, weights=total, family="binomial")
prop_summary <- summary(prop_model)
print(prop_summary$p.table)
print(prop_summary$s.table)

plot(prop_model)
```

                 Estimate  Std. Error  z value   Pr(>|z|)
    (Intercept)  1.173978  0.02709613  43.32641  0

            edf       Ref.df    Chi.sq     p-value
    s(x1)   4.591542  5.615235  798.9407   2.027751e-164

What does the intercept represent in this model?

-   Recall that the model uses the count outcomes to calculate the
    *logit*, which is the log odds ratio between successes and failures:

$$logit = log(\frac{N_{success}}{N_{failures}})$$

- If successes = failures, the ratio is 1 and the logit is 0 (i.e., log(1) =
0).
- If successes have a larger count than failures, the ratio is greater
than 1 and the logit has a positive value (e.g., log(2) = 0.69).
- If successes have a smaller count than failures, the ratio is lower
than 1 and the logit has a negative value (e.g., log(0.5) = -0.69).

Thus, the intercept is the log odds ratio of successes to failures
(logit), and indicates whether on average there are more successes than
failures. Here, the estimated intercept coefficient is positive, which
means that there are more successes than failures overall.

What does the smooth term indicate?

-   This represents how the log odds of successes vs failures changes
    over `x1` (time in this example). So, we see that since the *edf>1*,
    the proportion of successes increases faster over time. If, for
    example, the response represents the count of species A versus
    species B and nutrient concentrations are increased over time,
    these results would indicate that species A is increasingly observed
    as nutrient concentrations approach its niche optima over the course
    of the experiment.

## Visualizing the trend over time

Lastly, we will see the different ways this relationship could be
represented graphically.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(prop_model, select=1, scale=0, shade=TRUE)
abline(h=0)

out <- plot_smooth(prop_model, view="x1",main="")
(diff <- find_difference(out$fv$fit, out$fv$CI, xVals=out$fv$x1))
addInterval(0, lowVals=diff$start, highVals = diff$end, col='red', lwd=2)
abline(v=c(diff$start, diff$end), lty=3, col='red')
text(mean(c(diff$start, diff$end)), 2.1, "sign. more \n success", col='red', font=3)
```

What do these plots tell us about successes versus failures?

-   Left plot: contribution/ partial effect (if we had more than one
    explanatory variable). Over time the log odds increases, so over
    time successes increase and failures decrease.
-   Right plot: fitted values, intercept included (summed effect if we
    had more than one explanatory variable included in the model). Here
    we see that the log odds ratio is estimated around zero at the start
    of the experiment; this means there are equal amounts of successes
    and failures. Gradually successes increase, and at around `x1` = 400
    there are significantly more successes than failures (the smooth is
    significantly different from zero). We also illustrated how we could
    use the plot to determine at which `x1` value this occurs.

Lastly, to help interpret the results, we could transform the summed
effects back to proportions with the function `plot_smooth` from the
`itsadug` package:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot_smooth(prop_model, view="x1", main="",
            transform=plogis, ylim=c(0,1))
abline(h=.5, v=diff$start, col='red', lty=2)
```

As we already derived from the logit plot, we see that at around `x1` = 400
the proportion of successes increases significantly above 0.5.
