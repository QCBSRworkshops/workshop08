# Changing the basis function

We won't go too much further into this in this workshop, but you should
know you can expand on the basic model we've looked at today with:

-   more complicated smooths, by changing the basis,
-   other distributions: anything you can do with a GLM using the family
    argument,
-   mixed effect models, using gamm or the gamm4 package.

We will first have a look at changing the basis, followed by a quick
intro to using other distribution and GAMMs (Generalized Additive Mixed
Models). Let's look at one place where knowing how to change the basis
can help: cyclical data. That is, data where you want the predictor to
match at the ends. Imagine you have a time series of climate data,
broken down by monthly measurement, and you want to see if there's a
time-trend in yearly temperature. We'll use the Nottingham temperature
time series for this:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data(nottem)
n_years <- length(nottem)/12
nottem_month <- rep(1:12, times=n_years)
nottem_year <- rep(1920:(1920+n_years-1),each=12)
nottem_plot <- qplot(nottem_month,nottem, 
                    colour=factor(nottem_year), 
                    geom="line") + theme_bw()
print(nottem_plot)
```

Using the nottem data, we have created three new vectors; `n_years`
corresponds to the number of years of data (20 years), `nottem_month` is
a categorical variable coding for the 12 months of the year, for every
year sampled (sequence 1 to 12 repeated 20 times), and `nottem_year` is
a variable where the year corresponding to each month is provided.

Monthly data from the years 1920 through to 1940:

To model this, we need to use what's called a cyclical cubic spline, or
`"cc"`, to model month effects as well as a term for year.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
year_gam <- gam(nottem~s(nottem_year)+s(nottem_month, bs="cc"))
summary(year_gam)$s.table
plot(year_gam,page=1, scale=0)
```

There is about 1-1.5 degree rise in temperature over the period, but
within a given year there is about 20 degrees variation in temperature,
on average. The actual data vary around these values and that is the
unexplained variance. Here we can see one of the very interesting
bonuses of using GAMs. We can either plot the response surface (fitted
values) or the terms (contribution of each covariate) as shown here. You
can imagine these as plots of the changing regression coefficients, and
how their contribution (or effect size) varies over time. In the first
plot, we see that positive contributions of temperature occurred
post-1930.

Over longer time scales, for example using paleolimnological data,
others ([Simpson & Anderson 2009; Fig.
3c](http://www.aslo.info/lo/toc/vol_54/issue_6_part_2/2529.pdf)) have
used GAMs to plot the contribution (effect) of temperature on algal
assemblages in lakes, to illustrate how significant contributions only
occurred during two extreme cold events (that is, the contribution is
significant when the confidence intervals do not overlap zero, at around
300 and 100 B.C.). This allowed the authors to not only determine how
much variance was explained by temperature over the last few centuries,
but also pinpoint when in time this effect was significant. If of
interest to you, the code to plot either the response surface
(`type = "response"`) or the terms (`type = "terms"`) is given below.
When terms is selected, you obtain the same figure as above.

Contribution plot:
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pred<-predict(year_gam, type = "terms", se = TRUE)
I<-order(nottem_year)
plusCI<-I(pred$fit[,1] + 1.96*pred$se[,1])
minusCI<-I(pred$fit[,1] - 1.96*pred$se[,1])
xx <- c(nottem_year[I],rev(nottem_year[I]))
yy <- c(plusCI[I],rev(minusCI[I]))
plot(xx,yy,type="n",cex.axis=1.2)
polygon(xx,yy,col="light grey",border="light grey")
lines(nottem_year[I], pred$fit[,1][I],lty=1)
abline(h=0)
```
